**SPAMMING TOO MUCH  MAGUS ANOMALY DRASTICALLY REDUCES FPS** ( yes the game is well done... )

:::info
Very often it's the host who uses the Magus Anomaly to avoid too many problems, but there's nothing stopping others from using it too. The Magus states: upon Transference in, enemies are pulled towards your Warframe within a radius of 30m, which is very useful when enemies are hidden behind an obstacle or remain stuck in certain places because your Kavat is trying to attack them.


To spam your Transference, simply press your Transference key (by default it's the "5" key) followed by a melee attack, and repeat this procedure.

**Magus Aggress** , on Warframe Melee Transfer, causes Heavy Blades and Hammers ( **Magistar** ) to deal bonus Critical Multiplier for the next 4 attacks, with a 20 second cooldown.
This Magus will only be used for  [Magistar Acolyte Killer](./weapons.md)

> NOTE pour moi : video Animation Cancel 
>You can cancel the melee/transference animation with a roll, cast the cage, but the fastest method is to use her whip right after her melee attack
