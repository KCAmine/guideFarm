### <u> <strong> Method Origin System </strong> </u> 

Enter through this door indicated by the red circle, you will be taken to a small room with a staircase, [Khora](../builds/khoraOrigin.md) will have to put the cage (where it is indicated on the picture). 

<div style="margin-top: 20px;">

</div>

**The remainder of the game is simple:**
- If you are playing in (OS), [Khora](../builds/khoraOrigin.md) kills the enemies with her cage, [Nekros](../builds/nekrososSp.md) uses **Desecrate + Pull/Rage**, and [Nova](../builds/novaosSp.md )speeds up the enemies. 
- Extract  when Khora can't kill anymore with her  cage (around 30-35 minutes).

- If you are in (SP), [Khora](../builds/khoraSteelPath.md) kills the enemies trapped in the cage with her whipclaw, and the role of [Nekros](../builds/nekrososSp.md) and [Nova](../builds/novaosSp.md) remains unchanged

:::tip
- We can use **Rage**  (Helminth) on certain textures that the game considers transparent, which is useful for boosting enemies without having direct line of sight on them

<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
   <img src="./assets/uranusTipI.png" alt="uranus tip I  " style="width:90%; height:auto;" />
</div>

- Enemies will get stuck there (as shown in the image). All you have to do, just press "pull" (Helminth) them out

<div style="margin-top: 20px;">

</div> 

- The issue we regularly encounter at the farming spot is this: enemies often get stuck at this location. You'll need to kill them quickly to refresh their spawn

### <u> <strong> Method Steel Path </strong> </u> 

- [Khopra](../builds/khoraSteelPath.md) puts her dome in the place indicated by the red circle
- [Nekros](../builds/nekrososSp.md#pull) pulls enemies that are within the green circles.
- A [Nekros](../builds/nekrososSp.md#rage) with Rage will be very useful, as there are many transparent textures that he can exploit to speed up the enemies
- [Nova](../builds/novaosSp.md#quiver) will increase mob speed and make the squad invisible with **Quiver**

### <u> <strong> Position - Role </strong> </u> 

[Khora](../builds/khoraOrigin.md) is the main source of DPS and loot. 

- Kill enemies with her cage in the [Origin System](../builds/khoraOrigin.md) and with the whip if you play in [Steel Path](../builds/khoraSteelPath.md).
- Place her cage in the right spots,
- Set Venari to 'Heal' on an ally to prevent them from running around and blocking enemies


[Nova](../builds/novaosSp.md) will increase the speed of the enemies so they run directly into Khora's cage. 
In the mission, 
-  Press 4 to boost the mobs' speed, and that's it. 
- Can spam [Magus Anomaly](../builds/operator.md#magus-anomaly) 
- Use the Helminth ability she has equipped (e.g. quiver, rage).


[Nekros](../builds/nekrososSp.md) allows us to re-loot killed enemies with his ability **Desecrate**, thus increasing our resource gains.
- Cast third ability  (Desecrate) and his Helminth ability, Rage, to increase the speed of the enemies and their vulnerability to damage.

- Alternatively, he can use **Pull** to bring the enemies into the cage or to unstick them.
*It is always preferable to have one Nekros with [Pull](../builds/nekrososSp.md#pull) and one Nekros with [Rage](../builds/nekrososSp.md#rage) in the team*

### <u> <strong> Method Steel Path </strong> </u> 

- [Khora SP](../builds/khoraOrigin.md) puts her dome in the place indicated by the red point on the image below
- [Nekros Pulls](../builds/nekrososSp.md#pull) enemies in the dome
- [Nekros Petrify](../builds/nekrososSp.md#petrify) will be very useful, for even more resources
- [Nova Rage](../builds/novaosSp.md#rage) on enemies for Damage Vulnerability and movement speed
- [Nova Quiver](../builds/novaosSp.md#quiver) makes mobs aggro on you and shoot from a distance, causing them to stay in a fixed spot and not move.

- Wait for the enemies to be petrified; do not spam the ability.
- Place her cage in the right spots,

[Nova](../builds/novaosSp.md) will increase the speed of the enemies so they run directly into Khora's cage.
 - Press 4 to boost the enemies' speed, and that's it.
- Can spam [Magus Anomaly](../builds/operator.md#magus-anomaly)

[Nekros](../builds/nekrososSp.md) allows us to re-loot killed enemies with his ability  **Desecrate**, thus increasing our resource gains.

- [Pull](../builds/nekrososSp.md#pull) to bring enemies into the cage or unstick them.
- [Petrify](../builds/nekrososSp.md#petrify) for additional loot (Khora needs to wait for your petrification before killing the enemies). *This method is much harder to set up*
